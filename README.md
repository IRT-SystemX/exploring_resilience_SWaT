# exploring_resilience_SWaT
Datasheet and scripts for the resilience assessment of SWaT

This repository contains :
  - An Excel file with the matrices representing the four architectures of SWaT : A0, A1, A2, A12.
  - A Matlab script which reads the matrices in the Excel file and then, compute the spectral radius of each architecture.

To make it work, don't forget to set-up the local path (in the Matlab script) where you saved the Excel file on your computer.
